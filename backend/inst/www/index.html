    <h1>OpenCPU App Demo - test</h1>
    
    <p>
      The sole purpose of this OpenCPU app is to demonstrate how to use the <a href="http://github.com/jeroenooms/opencpu.js"><tt>opencpu.js</tt></a> library to call R from Javascript using OpenCPU. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The opencpu.js library depends on jQuery and provides some convenient wrappers around $.ajax to call the OpenCPU API.
    A copy of jquery and opencpu.js must be included with your OpenCPU app.</p>
    
    <h2>Topics</h2>
    
    <p>Each topic consists of a minimal HTML page demonstrating basic functionality. Look at the source code of the HTML page to learn what is happening.</p>
